  abstract = {De novo design seeks to generate molecules with required property profiles by virtual design-make-test cycles. With the emergence of deep learning and neural generative models in many application areas, models for molecular design based on neural networks appeared recently and show promising results. However, the new models have not been profiled on consistent tasks, and comparative studies to well-established algorithms have only seldom been performed. To standardize the assessment of both classical and neural models for de novo molecular design, we propose an evaluation framework, GuacaMol, based on a suite of standardized benchmarks. The benchmark tasks encompass measuring the fidelity of the models to reproduce the property distribution of the training sets, the ability to generate novel molecules, the exploration and exploitation of chemical space, and a variety of single and multiobjective optimization tasks. The benchmarking open-source Python code and a leaderboard can be found on https://benevolent.ai/guacamol.},

  abstract = {Due to the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, there is an urgent need for novel therapies and drugs. We conducted a large-scale virtual screening for small molecules that are potential CoV-2 inhibitors. To this end, we utilized "ChemAI", a deep neural network trained on more than 220M data points across 3.6M molecules from three public drug-discovery databases. With ChemAI, we screened and ranked one billion molecules from the ZINC database for favourable effects against CoV-2. We then reduced the result to the 30,000 top-ranked compounds, which are readily accessible and purchasable via the ZINC database. Additionally, we screened the DrugBank using ChemAI to allow for drug repurposing, which would be a fast way towards a therapy. We provide these top-ranked compounds of ZINC and DrugBank as a library for further screening with bioassays at https://github.com/ml-jku/sars-cov-inhibitors-chemai.},

However, method comparison is difficult because of various flaws of the currently employed evaluation metrics. We propose an evaluation metric for generative models called Fréchet ChemNet distance (FCD). The advantage of the FCD over previous metrics is that it can detect whether generated molecules are diverse and have similar chemical and biological properties as real molecules.},

  abstract = {We show that the transformer attention mechanism is the update rule of a modern Hopfield network with continuous states. This new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension) many patterns, converges with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. The number of stored patterns is traded off against convergence speed and retrieval error. The new Hopfield network has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. Transformer and BERT models operate in their first layers preferably in the global averaging regime, while they operate in higher layers in metastable states. The gradient in transformers is maximal for metastable states, is uniformly distributed for global averaging, and vanishes for a fixed point near a stored pattern. Using the Hopfield network interpretation, we analyzed learning of transformer and BERT models. Learning starts with attention heads that average and then most of them switch to metastable states. However, the majority of heads in the first layers still averages and can be replaced by averaging, e.g. our proposed Gaussian weighting. In contrast, heads in the last layers steadily learn and seem to use metastable states to collect information created in lower layers. These heads seem to be a promising target for improving transformers. Neural networks with Hopfield networks outperform other methods on immune repertoire classification, where the Hopfield net stores several hundreds of thousands of patterns. We provide a new PyTorch layer called "Hopfield", which allows to equip deep learning architectures with modern Hopfield networks as a new powerful concept comprising pooling, memory, and attention.

  abstract = {De novo design seeks to generate molecules with desired properties. The diversity of the generated molecules is of crucial importance for the success of drug discovery projects. However, previous comparisons of generative models in diverse optimization suffer from two common problems. Firstly, popular diversity metrics are not suited to quantify diversity in the context of de novo design. Secondly, many studies do not consider the search budget needed to find high-scoring molecules, resulting in unfair comparisons. In this study, we address these shortcomings and benchmark a range of generative models in diverse optimization tasks resulting in a meaningful overview of current model performance.},

  abstract = {Low-count time series describe sparse or intermittent events, which are prevalent in large-scale online platforms that capture and monitor diverse data types. Several distinct challenges surface when modelling low-count time series, particularly low signal-to-noise ratios (when anomaly signatures are provably undetectable), and non-uniform performance (when average metrics are not representative of local behaviour). The time series anomaly detection community currently lacks explicit tooling and processes to model and reliably detect anomalies in these settings. We address this gap by introducing a novel generative procedure for creating benchmark datasets comprising of low-count time series with anomalous segments. Via a mixture of theoretical and empirical analysis, our work explains how widely-used algorithms struggle with the distribution overlap between normal and anomalous segments. In order to mitigate this shortcoming, we then leverage our findings to demonstrate how anomaly score smoothing consistently improves performance. The practical utility of our analysis and recommendation is validated on a real-world dataset containing sales data for retail stores.},

  abstract = {It takes about a decade to develop a new drug by a process in which a large number of decisions have to be made. Those decisions are critical for the success or failure of a multi-million dollar drug discovery project, which could save many lives or increase life quality. Decisions in early phases of drug discovery, such as the selection of certain series of chemical compounds, are particularly impactful on the success rate. Machine learning models are increasingly used to inform the decision making process by predicting desired effects, undesired effects, such as toxicity, molecular properties, or which wet-lab test to perform next. Thus, accurately quantifying the uncertainties of the models’ outputs is critical, for example, in order to calculate expected utilities, to estimate the risk and the potential gain. In this work, we review, assess and compare recent uncertainty estimation methods with respect to their use in drug discovery projects. We test both, which methods give well calibrated prediction and which ones perform well at misclassification detection. For the latter, we find the entropy of the predictive distribution performs best. Finally, we discuss the problem of defining out-of-distribution samples for prediction tasks on chemical compounds.},

To find such routes, computer-assisted synthesis planning (CASP) methods are employed, which rely on a single-step model of chemical reactivity. In this study, we introduce a template-based single-step retrosynthesis model based on Modern Hopfield Networks, which learn an encoding of both molecules and reaction templates in order to predict the relevance of templates for a given molecule. The template representation allows generalization across different reactions and significantly improves the performance of template relevance prediction, especially for templates with few or zero training examples. With inference speed up to orders of magnitude faster than baseline methods, we improve or match the state-of-the-art performance for top-k exact match accuracy for k ≥ 3 in the retrosynthesis benchmark USPTO-50k.
