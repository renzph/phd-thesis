\chapter*{Abstract}
In recent years, the use of generative models in drug discovery has gained significant attention. Advances in deep
learning have led to the application of deep neural networks to solve various tasks requiring the generation of
molecular structures. This thesis focuses on two major applications of generative models in drug discovery: de novo
molecular design and retrosynthesis prediction. We investigate limitations of existing evaluation strategies for
generative models in de novo molecular design and propose improved methodologies. Furthermore, we present a novel method
for retrosynthesis prediction. 

The first part of this thesis examines observed failure modes in evaluating generative models for de novo molecular
design. We demonstrate that commonly used metrics used to evaluate distribution-learning models are not sufficient to
differentiate complex models from trivial baseline generators. Furthermore, we show how goal-directed molecule
generators can overfit to machine learning-based objective functions, leading to overestimation of model performance and
generation of molecules that are biased towards already known high scoring molecules. 

The second part introduces a diversity-based benchmark for goal-directed molecule generators, which quantifies a model's
ability to generate diverse sets of molecules with desired properties. Previous studies on diverse molecule optimization
have been limited by inadequate diversity measures, non-standardized compute budgets, and lack of model adaptation to
the diverse optimization setting. Our benchmark addresses these shortcomings, providing a standardized framework for
evaluating goal-directed molecule generators in the diverse optimization setting, enabling fair model comparisons.

In the third part, we propose a novel template-based retrosynthesis prediction model based on Modern Hopfield Networks.
Our model learns representations of the target molecule and reaction templates, and how to associate them. This enables
generalization over reaction templates and improves performance, particularly for rare templates. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining significantly lower computational costs compared to existing methods.

Through our work, we provide insights into the limitations of current evaluation strategies for generative models for
molecules while proposing new ones. Additionally, our contribution in retrosynthesis prediction enables more accurate
computer-aided synthesis planning. Collectively, these advances have the potential to accelerate the drug discovery
pipeline and facilitate the development of novel pharmaceutical treatments. }%
