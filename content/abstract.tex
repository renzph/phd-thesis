\chapter*{Abstract}
In recent years the use of generative models in drug discovery has seen increased attention, as
novel deep learning architectures have shown great flexibility in generating molecular structures.
Two main applications of generative models in drug discovery are de novo molecular design and
retrosynthesis prediction. However, the evaluation of generative models in de novo molecular design
is challenging and existing benchmarks and evaluation metrics often may not reflect the practical
utility of the models. In this thesis, investigate the limitations of current evaluation metrics and
propose new evaluation strategies for generative models in drug discovery. In addition, we introduce
a novel approach for retrosynthesis prediction, a crucial task in computer-aided synthesis planning.

The first part of this thesis focuses on observed failure modes in the evaluation of generative
models for de novo molecular design. In particular we show that commonly used metrics used to
evaluate distribution-learning are not sufficient to differentiate complex models from trivial
baseline generators. Secondly, we show how goal-directed molecular generators can overfit
to machine learning-based objective functions, leading to biases towards the training data and
overestimation of the model's performance.

The second part introduces a diversity-based benchmark for goal-directed molecule generators,
which measures the ability of a model to generate diverse sets of molecules with desired properties.
Previous studies on diverse molecule optimization have been limited by inadequate diversity
measures, non-standardized compute budgets, and lack of model adaptation to the diverse optimization
setting. Our benchmark addresses these shortcomings, providing a standardized framework for
evaluating diverse, goal-directed molecule generators and enabling fair model comparisons.

The third part of this thesis focuses on retrosynthesis prediction a crucial task in computer-aided
synthesis planning (CASP). We propose a novel template-based retrosynthesis prediction model based
on Modern Hopfield Networks. Our model takes both the target molecule and the reaction templates as
input, which allows it to generalize over reaction templates, which improves performance,
particularly on rare templates. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a
significantly lower computational cost compared to existing methods.

Through our work, we provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of
current generative models for molecules while proposing novel evaluation
strategies. Additionally, our contributions in retrosynthesis prediction enables
more accurate computer-aided synthesis planning. Collectively, these advances
have the potential to accelerate the drug discovery pipeline and facilitate the
development of novel pharmaceutical treatments.
