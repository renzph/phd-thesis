Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to Günter for giving me the opportunity of doing a PhD under his guidance
and learn from his invaluable experience and knowledge. I really appreciate the ongoing support and encouragement
throughout this journey, both academically and personally. 

A special thank you also goes to Sepp, who grew an incredible research group and environment over the past two decades.
This work would not have been possible without your constant engagement and dedication. 

I am equally grateful to all the amazing colleagues I had the privilege to work alongside. My deepest thanks to everyone
at the Institute for Machine Learning for many hours fruitful discussions. Thanks to Vihang, Theresa, Andi Mayr,
Johannes L., Johannes S., Lukas, Sebastian L., Andi Mi., Andreu, Markus Holzleitner, Sohvi, Daniel, Andreas F., Thomas
A., Angela, Andi R., Kristina and Johannes Ko. A special mention goes to Philipp S. for being an amazing co-author and
an even better person.

I would also like to acknowledge my industry partners Jörg, Dries, Natalia and Paulo for their exceptional collaboration
and for making this project an enriching experience.

A heartfelt thanks to Birgit and Jenny for keeping the institute running smoothly 
and to Herbert keeping our GPUs up and running.

To my family and friends, thank you for your unwavering and unconditional support. Thank you for always being there for me 
and making life worth living.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my partner Jordan for being so understanding of all the stresses and
frustrations that came with this thesis. Thank you for being an amazing support and for being part of my life.
