Thank you all.
% I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Dr. GÃ¼nter Klambauer for his guidance
% and support throughout the course of this thesis. I am also grateful to Sepp Hochreiter 
% without whom this work would not have been possible. 

% I would like to thank my colleagues at the Institute of Machine Learning for
% many hours of fruitful discussions and exchange. It was a pleasure being around
% you. Especially I would like to thank my co-author Philipp S. It was such a
% pleasure collaborating with you, and I'm grateful to have had such a great
% colleague to work with. Big thanks also go out to Vihang, Theresa and my
% favourite non-co-author Johannes. A big thank you also goes to Birgit and Jenny
% who do an awesome job of keeping the institute running, and keeping us all sane.
% Herbert and the IT team also deserve a big thank you for keeping our GPUs up and
% running.

% A special thank you goes to my family for their unconditional support. Thank you 
% Alfred, Eveline, Sarah, and Wolfgang, Ronja, Raphi for always being there for me. 

% Finally, I would like to all my friends for their support and for just being
% there. This includes the kayakers, acro people, and the legendary PL crew
% (including the ones who would not call it that.). You're al-rye-ght. Life would
% not as rich without you. Special thanks go out to Alex and Alina. I'm lucky to
% have you as friends. 

% Last but not least, I would like to thank my partner, Jordan. Although you only 
% joined me for the last part of this journey, you have been a constant source of
% support and love. I'm grateful to have you in my life.
